More Detailed Caption:
The image is a table that shows four examples of open-ended and closed-ended VOA results by Med3DVLM and M3D-LaMed. The table is divided into four sections, each with a different question answer. 

The first section is titled "Open-ended visual question answering" and has a question that reads "What plane is the image in?" The second section is labeled "Ground Truth: Aaxial". The third section is labelled "Where is the location located?" The fourth section has a list of questions that ask the viewer to answer. The fifth section has an image of the left lung and the sixth section has two questions.

Each question is accompanied by a brief description of the question. The questions are written in black text on a white background. The text is in a clear and concise manner, making it easy to read and understand.
