It is divided into two sections. \n\nOn the left side of the image, there is a diagram that explains the different stages of the model. The first stage is labeled \"Contrastive Training\" and shows a cross-sectional view of a patient's brain. The second stage is titled \"Text Encoder (Clinical)\". The diagram shows a table with three columns and three rows. The table is labeled with the names of the stages.\n\nThe first column is labeled as \"Vision Encoder\" and has a red arrow pointing to it, indicating the direction of the flow of data. The third column is labelled as \"Multimodal Projector (MLP-Mixer)\" and has an orange arrow pointing towards it. The fourth column has a blue arrow pointing down to the next stage, indicating that the model is being used to generate a medical report based on this image. The fifth column has the model number \"LLM with LORA\" and a label that reads \"Multimedia Projector\".\n\nOverall, the image shows how the model works and how it works.",
