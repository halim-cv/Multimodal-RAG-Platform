Chapter 4: Agent Models and Architectures 
 
I. Introduction 
An agent perceives the environment using its sensors and it acts on its environment using 
its effectors. So, an agent can always be seen as a function linking its perceptions to its actions. 
We obtain a typology of agents if we answer the question: why does an agent act? 
Answer: How to implement the actions efficiently according to the current situation of the 
environment or other agents.  
Multi-agent systems are generally classified into two main families: 
 cognitive systems  
 and reactive systems.  
II. Agent models 
II.1. reactive agent 
Because it reacts to external events. A reactive agent just reacts immediately to changes 
in the environment.  
 they act according to a pattern of stimuli/reaction (response) to events coming from their 
environment. 
 according to a reflection pattern by responding to signals from the environment  
II.1.1. Characteristics of a reactive agent 
 Individually, reactive agents are not "intelligent" (without anticipation, without 
planning) 
 because of their large number, these reactive agents can solve problems described as 
complex  
 No explicit representation of their environment or other agents. 
 Situated actions (ants) 
 Communication via the environment by propagating signals (the environment is 
fundamental for the coordination of actions between several agents)  
 Work on these agents is more interested in modeling a society of agents 
 areas of research: artificial life, ethology (anthill, termite nest, beehive), etc.  
2 
 
 it simply contents itself with acquiring perceptions and Reacting to them by applying 
certain pre-defined type rules (situation, action).  
 it is likened to a transition function T: this function is an unordered set of type rules:  
- If condition then action  
- which are executed in an infinite and non-deterministic loop  
- behavior driven by perceptions  
 
 
 
 
 
Example of a Reactive agent 
 
- If FD and DO Then EXIT 
- If FD and DC Then OPEN 
- If FD and DL and K Then UNLOCK 
- If FD and DL Then RANDOM-WALK  
- If FK and K Then RANDOM-WALK  
- If FK and Not K Then TAKE-KEY  
 
Example of a Reactive agent  
- A guard in a game  
- As long as I see nothing, I follow my path 
- If I see an enemy  
- If he is not threatening and if I am not hurt, I attack 
him  
- If he is threatening or if I am hurt, I sound the alarm, 
and I walk away

II.2. Cognitive agent  
Each cognitive agent is specialized in a domain and can communicate with other agents. 
Agents are immersed in an environment in which they interact. Their structure revolves 
around three main functions: perceive, decide and act. It has a symbolic representation 
(memory capacities) of itself, its environment and other agents and is endowed with 
reasoning capacities. Each cognitive agent has a knowledge base including:  
 various information related to their areas of expertise  
 and the management of interactions with other agents and with its environment.  
They have explicit goals and plans to accomplish their goals => intentional: Planning 
(human beings) intentional behavior (explicit goals and plans)  
- Small groups of individuals can solve problems cooperatively, that need to coordinate 
their activity, and sometimes negotiate to resolve their conflicts 
II.2.1. How a cognitive agent works 
The cognitive agent has a plan P which it executes sequentially and deterministically and 
thus has sub-functions:  
 revision of beliefs,  
 cooperation (negotiation, coordination),  
 learning.  
Example of a cognitive agent  
 GO-TO FD  
 If DO Then EXIT  
 Else If DC Then OPEN ;EXIT  
 Else If DL Then If K Then 
UNLOCK;OPEN;EXIT  
 Else GO-TO FK; TAKE KEY; GO TO FD; 
UNLOCK; OPEN; EXIT I 
I.3. Deliberative agent  
Deliberative agents are agents that perform some deliberation to choose their actions.  
Such a deliberation can be done based on the goals of the agent or on a certain utility function. It 
4 
 
can take the form of a plan that reflects the sequence of actions that the agent must perform in 
order to achieve its goal  
II.4. Hybrid agent  
 Combination between the cognitive agent and the reactive agent.  
 Each of these previous categories is appropriate for a certain type of problem.  
 Nevertheless, for the majority of problems, neither a completely reactive architecture, nor 
a completely deliberative or cognitive architecture is appropriate,  
 Agents must be able to react very quickly in certain situations (reflex behavior), while in 
others they must behave with more reasoning.  
II.4.1. Reactive Agents vs Cognitive Agent  
Cognitive Agent Reactive Agents 
Explicit representation of the environment No explicit representation 
Can take into account its past No memorization of its history 
Complex agent Function stimulus/reaction 
Small number of agents Big number of agents 
 
II.5. Purely communicating agent  
(or software agent) an IT entity that:  
 Exists in an open computing system (heterogeneous networks and systems or a collection 
of processors, software and resources that they can use and they interact with) 
 can communicate with other agents,  
 has skills (services) that it can offer to other agents,  
 has a behavior, taking into account the resources and skills at its disposal and according 
to the communications it receives.  
 Compared to the notion of agent in general, A purely communicating agent is 
distinguished:  
- it has no perception of other agents  
- it does not act in an environment (its development context is naturally that of 
computer networks).  
II.6. Purely situated agent  
 Purely situated agent: a physical entity that: 
5 
 
 is located at a position in an environment •  
 able to perceive (but in a limited way) its environment  
 has a behavior, taking into account the resources and skills at its disposal and the 
perceptions  
 compared to the notion of agent in general, A purely situated agent is distinguished:  
- communications are generally not made directly, but indirectly through 
perceptions and their actions in the environment.  
II.7. Mobile Agent  
Initially introduced in 1994 with the Telescript environment. The mobile agent paradigm 
lies at the crossroads of two research areas: multi-agent systems and code mobility with more 
particularly process migration. 
Mobile agents bring to these so-called stationary agents the ability to move on the 
different nodes of a network in order to work locally on the resources.  
 an agent capable of migrating autonomously to the different sites of a network,  
 first of all, the mobile agent code and data are hosted in computer A  
 data and code are migrated to computer B.  
 After the migration, the code is executed with the data and resources available on 
computer B.  
They can provide a practical, efficient and robust framework for implementing distributed 
applications and intelligent environments such as grid computing for several reasons:  
- the search for performance  
- ease of adaptability and development of distributed applications.  
- reduced communication costs  
- reduce vulnerability  
- asynchronous execution  
- dynamic software deployment,  
- has a behavior,  
- They can reduce 
communication costs

III. Agent architectures  
III.1. Agent structure  
There are several ways to design agents, but regardless of the architecture adopted, an 
agent can always be seen as a function linking its perceptions to its actions. This function is 
realized and implemented by:  
 agent program that runs on a  
 architecture which also organizes the interface with the environment (perceptions, 
actions)  
Agent = Architecture + Program (behaviour) 
 
The characteristics of an architecture are:  
 physical: a kind of processing equipment with physical sensors and effectors (ordinary 
PC, robotic car with several onboard computers, cameras, and other sensors) or virtual 
as in the case of software agents 
 the architecture disposes the available perceptions of sensors to the program, executes the 
program, and puts the actions chosen, by the latter, to the effectors.  
III.2. Agent program  
The agent program implements the desired agent function. It is invoked for each new 
percept and returns an action each time: just takes the current percept from the sensors as input 
and returns an action to the effectors. The actions taken describe the behavior of the agent. An 
agent implements a behavior based on:  
 what it can do (its skills),  
 its perceptions,  
 its representation of the world  
 and the communications it has with others or with its environment. The principal of IA is: 
- how to write programs that produce rational behavior from a small amount of 
code rather than a large number of table entries  
- The agents have the same skeleton: acquiring percepts from an environment and 
generating actions using internal data structures, updated with each new percept 
arrived.

III.2.1. Agent Program Types  
Russel and Norvig group agent programs into several types, namely:  
 TABLE-DRIVEN "Table-lookup" agent example: automated taxi  
 Simple reflex agents  
 Reflex agents based on models (with internal model of the world)  
 Goal-based agents  
 Utility-Based Full Agents  
The reflex types of agents are considered reactive agents and the latter two types are 
considered deliberative agents.  
III.3. Agent Architecture  
From a designer's point of view, the architecture of an agent describes the internal 
structure (software or hardware): how to assemble the different parts of an agent so that it 
performs the actions that are expected of it to from a set of inputs?  
In other words, the architecture of an agent is a particular methodology to specify the 
construction of agents in a set of modules. The architecture of an agent is a description of its 
internal organization: the knowledge of the agent, the operations that can be performed and the 
control flow of operations. The choice of an architecture depends on:  
 designer's decision  
 how perceptions relate to actions.

III.4. Types of architecture 
III.4.1. Abstract Architecture  
 S = {s1, s2, …} set of states of the environment.  
 The skills of an agent are represented by the set of actions it can perform A = {a1, a2, 
…},  
 An agent can be seen as a function: Act: S* A  
 which maps a sequence (*) of states of the environment to actions.  
III.4.1.1. Abstract Architecture (Purely Reactive Agent)  
Agents decide what to do without reference to histories:  
9 
 
 Decision making is based only on the present without any reference to the past.  
 sometimes called tropic agents because they simply respond directly to their 
environment.  
 formally, the behavior of a purely reactive agent can be represented by the function: 
action: S  A  
 The abstract model must be refined (break down into subsystems)  
 The first functional decomposition of an agent is made between perception and its 
decision process on actions  
 Let P be the set of perceptions and “capture” the 
function which makes the states of the environment 
correspond to the perceptions  
 capture: S  P  
 Act: P*  A  
 2 states s1 and s2 are equivalent for the agent if it 
perceives them in a unique way: s1∈ S and s2 ∈ S and capture(s1)=capture(s2).  
III.4.1.2. Abstract Architecture (Agent with state)  
To use its past, an agent can keep its history. Let “I” be the set of internal states of the agent, 
the decision process is expressed from I, to act: I A  
 This memorization process requires the 
accumulation of knowledge by the function: 
Compile (deliberate): I * P  I 
 therefore, the agents operate according to the new 
cycle: capture - compile - act.  
 The agent perceives the world through capture, 
updates its state through compile, then chooses an 
action to perform through act,  
III.4.2. Concrete architecture  
III.4.2.1. BDI architectures  
A BDI architecture is central to the BDI theory of rational action, first proposed by 
Michael Bratman. The agent decides on the actions to be taken from its internal states which are 
expressed in the form of:  
10 
 
 Belief: knowledge of the world; the information that the agent has about the environment 
and about other agents, through its ability to perceive or through interaction with other 
agents, which is used to calculate the values of the desires (criteria). 
 Desire: goals of the agent, represent the states of the environment, which the agent would 
like to see realized. are formalized as a set of criteria that will be used to evaluate plans to 
enable the agent to achieve its goals.  
 Intention: are the desires that the agent has decided to accomplish or the actions that it 
has decided to do to accomplish its desires corresponds to the chosen instantiated plan 
The "classic" agent systems that have implemented the BDI architecture are: IRMA = 
Intelligent Resource-bounded Machine Architecture, and PRS = Procedural Reasoning 
System  
 the control cycle of a BDI agent:  
 
 
 
Example: How farmers improve cropping system using BDI agent-based architecture?  
 Proposed solution: This model includes two types of entities:  
 agricultural agents: has the following state variables: Plots, plans, intention, desires, 
beliefs (memory-last-productions, weather-last-days, price-crop, cost-crop), water, 
finance.  
 the base of desires (4 desires (criteria)): Maximize profit, Minimize financial risks, 
Minimize workload, Maximize similarities with the last chosen plan  
 The following belief base (attributes): memory-last-productions, weather-last-days, 
crop-price, crop-cost, water.  
 intention: current cropping plan.  
11 
 
 parcel agents  
III.4.2.2. Layered architectures 
 Typically, at least 2 layers, one for reactive behavior and one for proactive behavior,  
 Ability to design multiple layers  
 Topology: information and flow control between several layers  
 two types of architectures: horizontal and vertical.  
III.4.2.2.a. Horizontal layered architectures  
 In this architecture, the software layers are linked to sensor inputs and action outputs.  
 Each layer behaves like an agent and produces proposals on the type of action to be 
performed independence and conceptual simplicity.  
 for "n" different types of behavior, then we implement "n" different layers.  
 competition between layers to suggest actions  
inconsistency problem of the global behavior of the 
agent.  
 need for layer mediation: making decisions about 
which layer will have control over the agent at any 
time.  
III.4.2.2.b. Vertical layered architectures  
 In this architecture, sensor inputs and action outputs are supported by at most one layer.  
 There are one-pass and two-pass vertical architectures.  
 One pass: in this architectural model, the information arrives from the sensors on 
a specialized layer, then passes through other layers in sequence until the last one 
which drives the output (action to be taken).  
 Two passes: in the two-pass architecture, the same layer provides the agent's 
input and output interface. The information follows the same path as in the 
previous mode, then descends the architecture in the opposite direction to return 
to the single front-end layer (interface) of the agent.

Example of a layered architecture  
 development of intelligent electronic messaging (E-mail) by exploiting the agent 
paradigm to model such a system (PhD competition).  
 the use of the agent paradigm for modeling this system because the system has 
autonomous components that act in parallel A global layer architecture of the system An 
architecture for the agents of the system 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Example of a layered architecture  
 development of an intelligent tutor (computer-assisted intelligent teaching system) using 
a multi-agent approach.  
 The problem to be solved is that of teaching the main database concepts where the 
different types of knowledge come from three sources: the pedagogical expert, the expert 
in the field to be taught and the student.  
 complex pbm, distribution and heterogeneity of different types of knowledge on a set of 
communicating agents  
 the E.I.A.O system (intelligent tutors) is organized around three modules:  
- the domain (problem solving or expertise module)  
- the student model  
13 
 
-  and the pedagogical expert (tutorial model)
