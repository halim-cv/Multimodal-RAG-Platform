chapter 6 : Interaction between agents 
I. Introduction 
A multi-agent system (MAS) is distinguished from a collection of independent agents by 
the fact that the agents interact. An interaction is a dynamic relationship between two or more 
agents through a set of reciprocal actions—“mutual actions.” 
Indeed, the value of multi-agent systems lies in the notion of collective action (collective 
behaviors) and in their ability to link the individual to the collective. The “collective” design 
emphasizes: 
the structures of interaction (cooperation, negotiation, coordination of actions, conflicts, 
etc.) 
and the organizational structures. 
II. Interaction
II.1. Objective
Agents interact in order to collectively accomplish a task or jointly achieve (contribute to 
fulfilling) a goal or the objective of the overall system. An agent that contributes to the 
satisfaction of the system’s global goal: 
will spend part of its time cooperating or coordinating with other agents, 
while still pursuing an individual objective. 
II.2. Dimensions 
Indeed, the system can progress toward one of its objectives and exhibit intelligent 
behavior regardless of the degree of complexity of the agents that compose it. The interactions 
between agents in a MAS are motivated by their interdependence along three dimensions: 
1. their goals may be compatible or not, 
2. agents may desire resources that others possess, 
1 
3. agent X may have a capability that agent Y needs to accomplish one of its action plans. 
II.3. Typology of Interactions 
In a MAS, direct actions are forbidden. An agent cannot act directly on the state or 
behavior of another agent or any element in its environment (object, other agent, human). 
Interaction between agents must occur through the sending of an ACL message → a request 
(formal or linguistic). 
The agent sends a request to an interlocutor, who is either another agent or a human in its 
environment (not an object!). The interlocutor interprets this request and may or may not satisfy 
it, depending on their own subjectivity (physical and mental state). 
2 
An interaction situation is a set of behaviors resulting from a group of agents who must 
act in order to satisfy their objectives, while taking into account constraints coming from the 
more or less limited resources available to them and from their individual skills. 
Example: building a house
the set of behaviors of the agents (the workers, the architect, the owner, the project 
manager) 
characterized by their objectives (the realization of the planned house according to the 
different viewpoints of the agents) 
and their skills (the expertise of the architect and the various trades) 
while considering the available resources (construction materials, finances, tools, 
buildable space, time). 
II.3. Types of Interactions 
A typology of interaction situations is defined according to the three main components of 
interaction: the nature of the goals, access to resources, and the agents’ competencies 
3 
Indifference: Independence of agents: no interactions occur between the agents because they 
have: 
compatible goals (in other words, their goals do not conflict), 
sufficient resources, 
the required capabilities. 
III. Cooperation
The compatibility of objectives will lead to cooperation whenever resources or skills are 
insufficient. Therefore, an agent must cooperate with other agents (to solve problems) because: 
it is not capable of accomplishing the task alone (cannot solve it individually), 
or others are more efficient. 
In a simplified manner, the problem of cooperation can be reduced to determining…

III.1. Perspectives on Cooperation 
There are two perspectives on cooperation: 
1. The intentional attitudes of agents who decide to work together. In this case, agents 
engage in an action after identifying and adopting a common goal considered an essential 
element of social activity. 
Example:
o Creating an association in which members identify a common objective and 
commit to participating in a shared task. 
o Robots that help each other carry weight. 
2. The observer’s perspective, who interprets behaviors afterwards, qualifying them as 
cooperative or not based on social (or physical) criteria: 
o interdependence of actions, 
o number of communications exchanged. 
Example:
o Construction of a termite nest, 
o the behavior of ants—where the observer notes certain phenomena used as 
indicators of cooperative activity. 
III.2. Objectives of Cooperation 
Four generic aims for establishing cooperation in a group of agents: 
increase the task completion rate through parallelism and positive interactions; 
increase the number of achievable tasks through the sharing of resources (information, 
expertise, physical devices, etc.); 
increase the chances of completing tasks by duplicating them and possibly using different 
modes of execution; 
reduce interference between tasks by avoiding negative interactions. 
III.3. Forms of Cooperation 
Three forms of cooperation can be distinguished: 
Confrontational cooperation: a task is performed by several agents with different 
specialties working concurrently on the same set of data, with the result obtained through 
fusion. 
Augmentative cooperation: a task is divided among similar agents working 
concurrently on disjoint subsets of data, with the solution obtained as a set of local 
solutions. 
5 
Integrative cooperation: a task is decomposed into sub-tasks accomplished by agents 
with different specialties working in a coordinated manner, with the solution obtained 
after all sub-tasks are completed. 
Example: airplanes flying in the same airspace
They have different perceptions of their surrounding environment, captured by their 
respective sensors. 
Only by combining these different perceptions can they obtain a global view 
allowing them to resolve potential conflicts that may arise between them. 
III.4. Methods of Cooperation 
Studying the conditions of cooperation reveals the means that can be used to achieve it. 
These means or methods of cooperation are six in number: 
grouping and multiplication, 
communication, 
specialization, 
collaboration through sharing tasks and resources, 
coordination of actions, 
conflict resolution through arbitration and negotiation. 
When agents carry out their actions, some actions executed simultaneously may either 
create conflicts or improve performance. Two types of relationships between agents’ actions can 
be distinguished: 
Negative conflicting relationships: hinder or prevent several actions from occurring 
simultaneously. 
Positive synergistic relationships: enhance actions by allowing them to benefit from 
each other. 
Therefore, cooperation among agents—aiming to produce a coherent global behavior of 
the MAS—requires sophisticated coordination mechanisms to avoid potential conflicts.

IV. Coordination 
Classic example: the pursuit problem (prey/predators)
Objective: capture a prey by surrounding it. 
What happens with 6 predators and 2 preys? (or more prey and more predators?) 
→ possible deadlocks... 
Problem: How can the actions of all these predators be coordinated? 
Early research in distributed artificial intelligence focused mainly on groups of agents 
pursuing common goals. In a multi-agent environment, new problems arise due to agents’ partial 
perception, the pursuit of local objectives, and the interleaving of agents’ activities. 
Goal: avoid chaotic behavior and maintain overall coherence. 
To achieve coherence, agents must: 
be able to recognize interactions and interdependencies between different sub-goals in 
order to either ignore or resolve them; 
take into account: 
o constraints imposed by other agents’ actions on the agent’s choice of actions; 
o constraints imposed by the agent’s commitments toward others on its own action 
choices; 
o the unpredictable evolution of the environment due to agents not modeled; 
avoid conflicting situations (antagonism, deadlock, starvation, etc.) that may result from 
poor handling of shared resources. 
Thus, interactions between cooperating agents require coordination.

IV.1. Cooperation vs. Coordination 
Cooperation focuses on how to distribute work among several agents, whether using 
centralized or distributed techniques. 
Action coordination analyzes how the actions performed by different agents are 
organized: 
organizing agents’ behaviors in time and space so that the group’s overall action is 
improved: 
by increasing performance (overall coherence), 
or by reducing conflicts (resolving potential conflicts). 
Thus, coordination allows each agent to anticipate the future actions of others. 
From the perspective of a MAS designer, coordination must answer the following 
questions: 
With which agents should a given agent coordinate its actions? 
(The solution is often provided by the problem itself — e.g., air traffic control.) 
When and where should these coordination actions be carried out? 
How to detect and manage interactions between actions (conflicts and reinforcements)? 
How to maintain coordination? By relying on: 
- mutual dependencies between actions: making the best use of agents’ degrees of 
freedom, 
- relationships between actions: analyzing positive and negative relationships.

IV.2. Types of Coordination 
Coordination by synchronization (through mutual adjustments). 
Example: synchronization of movements (cyclist’s legs), synchronization of access to a 
resource. 
Coordination by planning (from centralized to distributed): 
1. centralized planning for multiple agents, 
2. centralized coordination for partial plans, 
3. distributed coordination for partial plans. 
Coordination by regulation (standardization): e.g., through codes, laws, or social 
conventions (traffic code). 
Reactive coordination: stimulus–response style (reactive agents). 
IV.2.1. Coordination by Centralized Planning 
A central system (or agent) plans and distributes plans to the agents, solving 
synchronization and resource allocation problems. Planning for a single agent merely builds a 
sequence of actions considering only its goals, capabilities, and environmental constraints. 
A central planner has a global view of the entire system and handles the identification of 
interactions between the agents’ various activities and the resolution of all conflicts before plan 
execution. 
Thus, the other agents are simply executors. 
Centralized planning coordination consists of three steps: 
1. a general partial plan, expressed as an acyclic graph, 
2. branches that may run in parallel, with synchronization points where they join, 
3. allocation of tasks to executors. 
9 
IV.2.2. Distributed Coordination for Partial Plans 
several planner–executors who can communicate their plans to one another, 
coordination through the exchange of partial plans until the goals are satisfied, 
both planning and plan coordination are distributed.
